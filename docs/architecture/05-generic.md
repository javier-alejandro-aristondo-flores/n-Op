# Dynamics — GENERIC

Time evolution uses the **GENERIC** form (General Equation for the
Non-Equilibrium Reversible–Irreversible Coupling):

```
dx/dt = L · δE/δx + M · δS/δx
```

- `E[x]` — total energy functional.
- `S[x]` — total entropy functional.
- `L` — Poisson operator: antisymmetric; reversible dynamics.
- `M` — friction operator: symmetric, positive semidefinite; irreversible
  dynamics.
- Degeneracy conditions: `L · δS/δx = 0` (reversible part conserves entropy) and
  `M · δE/δx = 0` (dissipative part conserves energy).

Each traditional regime of multiphysics is recovered as an **extraction** of
this single equation. Static observables are equilibrium readouts (fixed points
where `dx/dt = 0`); time-evolving observables are trajectory readouts. The
structural residual that grounds every other is the **EOM-violation residual**
`‖dx/dt − (L δE/δx + M δS/δx)‖²`. Every other residual category in
`arch-11-residuals` is either a refinement of it (per state component, per
axis) or an algebraic identity the dynamics must satisfy. `/physics` emits the
full granular residual vector; aggregation into a scalar training objective
lives in `/informed-operator`.

### Canonical functionals and operators

The two functionals decompose as:

```
E[x] = E_kin(ions)      Σ_I |P_I|²/2M_I + tr(Π_hᵀΠ_h)/2W
     + E_BO(R, h)       min_γ̂ ⟨Ĥ_electronic⟩[γ̂; R, h]
     + E_KS[γ̂]          kinetic + Hartree + exchange-correlation on γ̂
     + E_EM[A]          (1/8π) ∫ (|E|² + |B|²) dr
     + E_coupling       Σ_{c ∈ CouplingSpec, v ∈ realize(c) | v.target = Scalar} v
                        — channels declared per arch-19-coupling-structure;
                          MVP set: electron-phonon, minimal coupling,
                          ion-ion electrostatic.

S[x] = S_vib           vibrational entropy from the phonon spectrum
     + S_electronic     Fermi–Dirac entropy of the γ̂ spectrum
     + S_config         configurational entropy of coarse-grained DOFs
```

The two operators decompose as:

```
L (antisymmetric Poisson):
  · symplectic on (R, P)         canonical ion phase space
  · symplectic on (h, Π_h)       Parrinello–Rahman cell phase space
  · Liouville–von Neumann on γ̂   (1/iℏ) [Ĥ_KS, ·]
  · Maxwell on A                 Hamiltonian form of the EM field
  · semiclassical streaming      on emergent distributions
  · cross-blocks                 Σ_c Σ_{v ∈ realize(c) | v.target = AntisymmForm} v
                                 (arch-19-coupling-structure)

M (symmetric, positive semidefinite):
  · diagonal kernels             per-component dissipation (intra-block)
  · cross-kernels                Σ_c Σ_{v ∈ realize(c) | v.target = PSDSymmForm} v
                                 (arch-19-coupling-structure;
                                  MVP set: phonon-phonon and electron-phonon
                                  scattering kernels)
```

These pieces are assembled across the four levels of §6; each level contributes
the `E`, `S`, `L`, and `M` terms that act on its irreducible state.

### The nine regimes as extractions

| Regime | Extraction |
|--------|-----------|
| Structural | Critical points of `E` at `T = 0` (or `F` at `T > 0`); 1st derivatives |
| Mechanical | 2nd strain-derivatives of `F` at equilibrium |
| Thermal | Eigendecomposition of `∂²E_BO/∂u²` (phonons); BTE for phonon distribution |
| Electronic | SCF as gradient flow on `E_KS`; TDKS as Liouville on `γ̂` (pure `L`) |
| Magnetic | spin-doubled `γ̂`; spin EOM = `L` (precession) + `M` (orientation-preserving relaxation `S × (S × H_eff)`) |
| Optical | Response of `γ̂` to `A(t)` via `L`; absorption via `M` (radiative damping) |
| Transport | BTE on emergent carrier distribution: `L` (streaming) + `M` (collisions) |
| Thermodynamic | min `F` at fixed `(T, V, N)`; convex hull of `{F_φ}` |
| Chemical/surface | Master equation on configurations (`M` = rate matrix); minimum-energy-path search on `E_BO` |

The per-regime derivations of each extraction from the unified structure are in
the `docs/implementation/` tree (especially `impl-06-compositions`) and grounded
in `physics/research/group-{A,B,C}-*.md`.
