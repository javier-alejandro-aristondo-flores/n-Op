# n-Op — Formula Registry (index)

The closed registry of named formulas is the load-bearing contract between the
property machinery and the PINO. The canonical, machine-readable list is
[`../physics/library/formulas/registry-manifest.csv`](../physics/library/formulas/registry-manifest.csv).
This file is the human-readable index over it.

## What the registry is

Every algebraic combination in `/physics` invokes a **named formula** with a
typed signature and an explicit output type — no inline math, no string-encoded
expressions. Each formula is a typing rule for a `FormulaApply` node in the
`PhysicsGraph` (see `architecture/06-physics-graph.md`); the registry is the
closed vocabulary that bounds Stage-1 graph construction. Each formula is
independently citable to published references and independently verifiable by
the cert sub-tree. New formulas enter only through a controlled, cert-validated
process; the registry is a contract, not a convenience.

## Counts

- **110 substantive formulas** (rows 1–102 + 105–112). Rows 105–112 are the
  slow-tier degradation / radiation formulas (`arch-21-multiscale-state §21.13`).
- **2 architectural markers** (rows 103–104) for relations enforced *by
  construction* and therefore **not** residualized: force = −∇energy (an
  autodiff identity) and equivariance (a structural constraint). They appear in
  the manifest so the decision is recorded, not so they generate loss.

Of the substantive rows:

- **Rows 1–87** are grounded directly in the domain research under
  `physics/research/` (the observable catalog, heterostructure/CSP,
  defects/surfaces/interfaces, non-equilibrium/high-field, and the
  residual-generator catalog).
- **Rows 88–102** are the **linear-response and topology-atlas extensions**:
  the long-range Coulomb directional-limit correction, the charged-supercell
  finite-size schemes, the linear-response primitives (Born effective charges
  Z\*, high-frequency dielectric ε∞, electronic susceptibility χ∞, lattice
  Coulomb scalar), the composition-dependent excess-free-energy basis, and the
  topology atlas (symmetry-indicator group via Smith Normal Form, elementary
  band representations, compatibility relations, Chern / Z₂ / Wilson-loop
  invariants, boundary-mode multiplicity).

## Columns

The manifest is a CSV with one row per formula:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `#` | Row number (stable identifier). |
| `Name` | Behavior-named identifier (person-attribution names appear only as parenthetical literature pointers). |
| `Signature` | Typed `(inputs) → output`, with units. |
| `Bundle` | Observable bundle membership, `B1`–`B11` (see `architecture.md §8.4`). |
| `Tier` | Cost tier `T0`–`T3`. |
| `Diff` | Differentiability tag `D0`–`D4`. |
| `Path` | **Retired column.** Under the always-cheap pipeline (see `architecture/07-pipeline.md`), every formula is on the single residual surface; the `cheap`/`faithful` distinction has been collapsed. The column survives in the CSV for historical row identity only. |
| `Source` | Provenance: the research grounding, or "extension" / "topology atlas" for rows 88–102. |
| `Depends on` | Upstream formulas / primitives. |

## Tag legend

**Cost tiers** — `T0` closed-form (≤10 µs) · `T1` small linear algebra / 1D
quadrature (≤10 ms) · `T2` Brillouin-zone / mesh integral (≤10 s) · `T3`
self-consistent loop or PDE solve (≤10 min).

**Differentiability** — `D0` no autodiff needed (pure read) · `D1` analytic
forward derivative · `D2` adjoint required (validated at registration) · `D3`
implicit-function adjoint via fixed-point linearization · `D4` autodiff relaxed
(surrogate-net bridge or finite-difference fallback, approved at registration).

## How a formula becomes a residual

At library load time the residual-generator factory reads each formula record
and produces a `ResidualGenerator` (see
`implementation/07-residual-factory.md`). The tags drive everything downstream:
the cost tier sets sampling cadence, the differentiability tag sets whether the
residual is gradient-bearing and triggers the registration-time adjoint gate
for `D2` entries, and the applicability classifier masks the residual per
training sample. Each generator unfolds along its declared `axes` to emit a
content-addressed `Map<ResidualKey, Scalar>`; weighting and aggregation belong
to `/informed-operator` (see `architecture/11-residuals.md`).
